2048 - In each round of the game, two tiles with the number "2" appear. By pressing the arrow keys, you need to move them in a direction, with tiles of the same "value" merging together. The player wins upon reaching the score of 2048. Successful merging earns points based on the tile's value. When there are no available moves left and your actions become impossible, a popup window will inform you about the game over.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS.
